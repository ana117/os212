# TIPS
1. Learn Git<br>
Learn about git. What is it, how to use it, and branching. If you don't want to learn about git, follow the lecturer's mantra, add, commit, pull, and push.

2. Use Your VM<br>
Try to do everything on your VM. Update log, link, rank, assignment, etc. Unix system have different text formatting and your lecturer know if you update those example not from your VM (that may/may not reduce your points).
